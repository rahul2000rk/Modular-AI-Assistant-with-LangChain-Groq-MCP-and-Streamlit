# Modular-AI-Assistant-with-LangChain-Groq-MCP-and-Streamlit
a modular AI assistant featuring a Streamlit-based chat interface for interactive queries and PDF-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

A modular AI assistant built with LangChain, Groq LLMs, and MCP (Modular Command Protocol), featuring:

✅ Tool-based architecture using MCP servers (Math, Weather, Time, PDF RAG)

🧠 LLM agent powered by Groq’s ultra-fast inference (e.g. Qwen & LLaMA3)

📄 PDF question answering via RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

💬 Streamlit GUI with live chat interface and document upload

🛠️ Easily extendable with new tools via the MCP protocol

Perfect for developers looking to build intelligent, modular assistants capable of reasoning, answering domain-specific questions, and interacting via a clean UI.
